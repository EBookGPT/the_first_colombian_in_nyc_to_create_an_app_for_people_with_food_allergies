Here is a revised outline based on the original plan and criticism:

**Title:** "Beyond Borders: A Colombian's Quest for Inclusive Innovation"

**Chapter 1: Finding Purpose**

* Introduce Juan, a 25-year-old Colombian immigrant who leaves his comfortable life in Medell√≠n to pursue his tech dreams in New York City.
* Show Juan's struggles to adjust to NYC life, from navigating the subway system to finding decent Colombian coffee.
* Introduce Juan's motivation for creating an app: a close call with a food allergy reaction in a NYC restaurant, which sparks his desire to create a solution to prevent similar incidents.
* Introduce Sofia, Juan's 10-year-old sister, who has severe food allergies and inspires Juan's app idea.

**Chapter 1.5: The Idea Takes Shape**

* Juan enrolls in a coding bootcamp to learn the skills needed to build his app, "SafeBite."
* He faces setbacks, such as lack of funding and self-doubt, but perseveres with the help of Alex, a food blogger and social media influencer who becomes his mentor.
* Juan meets Dr. Patel, a pediatrician who specializes in food allergies and provides valuable insights into the medical aspects of the condition.

**Chapter 2: SafeBite Takes Off**

* Juan launches SafeBite, which gains traction due to its user-friendly interface, personalized food recommendations, and community forum for users to share experiences.
* Juan navigates the complexities of entrepreneurship, balancing his passion for the app's mission with the pressures of growth and scalability.
* A rival app, "FoodSafe," emerges, creating tension and competition for Juan and his team.
* Sofia, now 12, becomes more involved in the app's development, using her experiences to inform features and advocate for the needs of young people with food allergies.
* Juan faces moral dilemmas, such as choosing between investors who want to acquire SafeBite and staying true to his mission.

This revised outline aims to address the critique by:

* Adding more depth to Juan's background and motivation
* Showing, not telling, Juan's struggles in NYC
* Introducing the app idea in a more organic way
* Developing Sofia's character and role in the app's development
* Expanding on the app's features and community forum
* Introducing rivalries and conflicts to make Juan's success more earned
* Exploring the themes of immigration, technology, and social impact in more depth
* Incorporating more sensory details of NYC and Colombian culture
* Balancing the tone to include more nuance and emotional depth
